An AI-powered quality control application that uses computer vision to detect anomalies in products. Built with TensorFlow and Streamlit to provide an intuitive, user-friendly interface for real-time anomaly detection.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dual Input Methods**: Upload images or use live webcam feed for real-time detection
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant feedback with confidence scores for detected anomalies
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive design with clear visual feedback
- **High Accuracy**: Powered by a custom TensorFlow model trained on product images

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam (for live detection feature)

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishil61/Anomaly-Inspector.git
   cd Anomaly-Inspector
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**
   - Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Download the model**
   
   The model file is too large for GitHub. Download it from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/your-model-link) and place it in the `model/` directory with the filename `teachable_machine_model.h5`.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

Start the Streamlit server:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## üìä Creating Your Own Model with Teachable Machine

You can create your own custom anomaly detection model using Google's Teachable Machine:

1. **Visit Teachable Machine**
   - Go to [teachablemachine.withgoogle.com](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
   - Click on "Get Started" and select "Image Project" ‚Üí "Standard Image Model"

2. **Prepare Your Dataset**
   - Create two classes: "Good" and "Anomaly"
   - For "Good" class: Upload 30+ images of products without defects
   - For "Anomaly" class: Upload 30+ images of products with defects/anomalies
   - Ensure images have varied lighting, angles, and positions for better generalization

3. **Train Your Model**
   - Click the "Train Model" button
   - Wait for training to complete (usually takes 1-3 minutes)

4. **Export Your Model**
   - Click "Export Model"
   - Select "Tensorflow" ‚Üí "Keras"
   - Download the model file (.h5 format)
   - Place the downloaded model in the `model/` directory with the name `teachable_machine_model.h5`

5. **Test Your Custom Model**
   - Restart the Anomaly Inspector application
   - Your custom model will be automatically loaded

## üñºÔ∏è Application Structure

- `app.py`: Main application file with Streamlit UI and logic
